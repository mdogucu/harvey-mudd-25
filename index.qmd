Other statements some in the direction of increases as well as US average is visible.

# Q1. What is data representation?

Data representation refers to the way we structure data in a way to make it easier for us to understand the trends, patterns, relationships that are found in the raw data. 

# 

:::{.font50} 

Data visualization is *one* way of representing data. We have also seen data sonification and data in tactile format (e.g., the sticks).


:::

# 

:::{.font50} 

Tables, maps, charts, plots, infographics are some ways of visualizing data.
:::

# 

:::{.font50} 
The coordinate system, length, width, area, volume, color, and, shape are ways we map data as visual elements.
:::

# 

:::{.font50} 
Different tools (e.g., pen, paper, digital platforms, software, physical objects) can be used to represent data.
:::

# 

:::{.font50} 

Data representations do not necessarily have to be made by a data scientist but you need to understand data science, domain discipline, and art.

:::

# 

:::{.font50} 
Data representations can be used for exploratory reasons and explanatory reasons.
:::


# Q2. How does one make good data visualizations? 


# Avoid deception

## Truncated Axis

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
#| fig-alt: The title of the plot reads "if Bush tax cuts expire" It is a bar plot the first bar is labeled as now at 35% the next bar is labeled as Jan 1, 2013 labeled at 39.6% The y axis starts at 34%.
include_graphics("img/fox.png")
```


:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
#| fig-alt: Same as the previous graph accept that the y axis goes from 0 to 40% and thus the bars don't seem that different from one another.

:::{.callout-tip}
Whenever possible start the axis at zero.

## Aspect ratio

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
#| fig-alt: three plots with same data. The x-axis always has year and the y-axis always has life expectancy. The plots are labeled as aspect ration 1:2, aspect ration 1:1, and aspect ration 2:1. In the first plot the x axis is double the y axis. In the third plot the y axis is double that of x axis. Thus in the first plot the trend can be perceived to have a low positive slope where as in the third plot the trend seems like a steeper positive change.

# Choose colors with a purpose


## Color for grouping

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
#| fig-alt: The title reads "Estimated share of children with blood levels at or above 5 micrograms per deciliter. Each country is shown as a circle on the plot scattered around with y axis labeled as going from higher rates of elevated lead levels around 100% to lower rates of elevated lead levels going all the way down to zero percent. Each circle has a different color which represents the region such as Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East, North America, Ocenia, and South America."

## Color for representing numeric values

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
#| fig-alt: The title of the plot reads "Local news is now an endangered species in much of the United States. The plot shows county level US map, each county is colored with the legent ranging from none (shown in red) to 10+ news outlets (shown in green)"

## Color for emphasis

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
#| fig-alt: The title of the plot states warmth in the Gulf of Mexico. On the x axis we see months, on the Y axis we see values ranging from 0 to 80 kJ/cm^2. We are also provided a text "This chart shows a measure of ocean heat content expressed by kilojoules per square centimeter". There are many gray curves each representing an individual year, and a dotted curve for showing average 2012-2023. These curves seem to pick between Aug-Oct. There is one curve that is red and has a specific point labeled as Oct 7, 2024. This curve seems above the dotted curve.

## Color Theory

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: The Hue bar (top) shows the full range of color hues mapped to degrees from 0° to 360°, wrapping around the color wheel—starting at red, through yellow, green, blue, magenta, and back to red. The Saturation bar (middle) shows how "intense" or "pure" the color is, going from 0% (completely desaturated, i.e., grayscale) to 100% (fully saturated, pure color). The Lightness/Brightness bar (bottom) shows how light or dark the color is, from 0% (black) to 100% (white), with the pure color appearing in the middle when lightness is 50%.

# An example

# Write alternate text

## Screen reader example

<div class="horizontal-center">

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-G4kKTuDHI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The video shows use of a screen reader briefly. 

</div>

## Alternate Text

:::{.nonincremental}
- "Alt text" describes contents of an image. 
- Screen-readers cannot read images but can read alt text. 
- Alt text has to be provided. 

:::


## Manual Alternate Text
:::{.nonincremental}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Chart type

- Type of data

- Reason for including the chart

- Link to data or source (not in alt text but in main text)


[Cesal, 2020](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Description conveys meaning in the data

- Variables included on the axes

- Scale described within the description

- Type of plot is described

# Consider ethical implications

## Ethics of data visualization

In the [Bayes Rules!](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-10) book, authors raise the following questions for model fairness. We can extend these to data visualizations.

> How was the data collected? By whom and for what purpose? How might the results of the analysis, or the data collection itself, impact individuals and society? What biases or power structures might be baked into this analysis?
