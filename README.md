## Abstract

Data visualization is a powerful tool for making sense of complex information, but not all charts and tables are created equal. In this talk, we’ll journey through the history of data visualization, exploring its interdisciplinary roots and foundational principles. You’ll learn practical tips and tricks for designing clear, compelling visualizations, uncover common pitfalls that distort data, and dive into the ethics of data storytelling—where bad statistical choices can mislead audiences. But data representation doesn’t stop at visuals! We’ll also explore alternative formats of representing data.
